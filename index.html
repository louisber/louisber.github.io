       		<h3><u>Evolution</u></h3>
       		<p style="font-family: Times New Roman">The Bayerische Motoren Werke introduced its original C Evolution electric scooter to the great proving ground that is the European scooter market all the way back in 2012 and it’s finally coming to the U.S. market. A boosted battery ampacity gives it the increased range needed to handle a long-distance commute, but it’s the electronics suite that really puts the C Evolution in a class of its own. Traction control, torque control and ABS all make an appearance along with the 35-horsepower motor that, according to the factory, has no problem running right up to the 80 mph governor. I had to remind myself more than once that this is still considered just a scooter though it could certainly embarrass many a low- to mid-range ride. Not just other scooters either, but proper motorcycles. Don’t believe it? Read on and I’ll make my caseGurney equipment was used on the Gloucester-Cheltenham service of four daily round trips; under favourable conditions the equipment could complete the 9 miles (15 km) in 45 minutes. Between February 27 and June 22, 1831, steam coaches ran 4,000 miles (6,400 km) on this route, carrying some 3,000 passengers. The equipment was noisy, smoky, destructive of roadways, and admittedly dangerous; hostility arose,</p>

          <h3><u>Kenyan Market</u></h3>
          <p style="font-family: Times New Roman">The automobile market in Kenya represents one of the biggest business opportunities over the coming decade and the political oligarchy assuming they follow both social and economic policies that favour a large development of pro capita income that could provide a good base for the middle class settlement that is rising in the nation is welcome. The extensive road network being rolled up in the countyr is much welcome especially tarmacking of such roads. While this article does not delve on the exorbitant cost it has taken to put up the roads, it does welcome the extensive road network in opening up the country and spurring economic growth.

          <p>Over the years the Volkswagen, Audi, Nissan Diesel, Nash, Marine crafts and Evinrude outboard engine franchises were added. The VW Beetle proved itself a star particularly after winning the East African Safari Rally four times. The introduction of the VW Microbus also proved successful and played an important role in revolutionizing transport in the tourist industry.           </p>
